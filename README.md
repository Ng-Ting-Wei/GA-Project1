# Survival RPG

A short survival game to defeat as many opponents as possible. There are two characters in game, Maximus and Regulius. Both are brothers that are participating in the arena to earn as much prestige as possible. (e.g highscores) The brothers and their opponents don't kill each other, only beating them until unconsciousness. So they don't really die and will be back for more.
The gameplay is clicking on the respective buttons to beat the guards, and when you level up, you get to increase your health, attack, defence or speed. The respective buttons uses their own stats, attack for attack, defence for defend and speed for quick attack.

# Next Steps

Future enhancement one: animation or image
Currently, there are no animations or images to simulate the various attacks and that there is no special effect when the player level up. I don't have enough time to be working on it as it takes more time to make it and combine the functions with it.

Future enhancement two: character creation
Currently, there are only two characters for the players to play. There is not enough time to fit into the game itself.
